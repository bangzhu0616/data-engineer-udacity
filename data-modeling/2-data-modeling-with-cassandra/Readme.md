### Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. There is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app. My role is to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions.

### Files

1. `Project_1B.ipynb` jupyter notebook for processing data and creating tables

2. `event_datafile_new.csv` combined all data files in `event_data`.
